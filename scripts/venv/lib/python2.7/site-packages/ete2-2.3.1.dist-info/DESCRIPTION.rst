The Environment for Tree Exploration (ETE) is a Python programming
toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and
visualization of phylogenetic trees (although clustering trees or any
other tree-like data structure could be used). 

ETE is currently developed as a tool for researchers working in
phylogenetics and genomics. If you use ETE for a published work,
