CNIDARIA: fast, reference-free phylogenomic clustering

![Travis Continuous Integration Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sauloal/cnidaria.svg?branch=master "Travis Continuous Integration Build Status")


Motivation: Identification of biological specimens is a major requirement 
for a range of applications. Reference-free methods analyse unprocessed 
sequencing data without relying on prior knowledge, but these do not scale 
to arbitrarily large genomes and arbitrarily large phylogenetic distances.

Results: We present Cnidaria, a practical tool for clustering genomic and 
transcriptomic data with no limitation on ge-nome size or phylogenetic 
distances. We successfully simultaneously clustered 169 genomic and 
transcriptomic datasets from 4 kingdoms, achieving 100% accuracy at 
supra-species level and 78% accuracy for species level.

Availability and Implementation: Cnidaria is written in C++ and Python and 
is available at http://www.ab.wur.nl/cnidaria.
