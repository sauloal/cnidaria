{"name":"Cnidaria","tagline":"","body":"CNIDARIA: fast, reference-free phylogenomic clustering\r\n\r\nMotivation: Identification of biological specimens is a major requirement \r\nfor a range of applications. Reference-free methods analyse unprocessed \r\nsequencing data without relying on prior knowledge, but these do not scale \r\nto arbitrarily large genomes and arbitrarily large phylogenetic distances.\r\n\r\nResults: We present Cnidaria, a practical tool for clustering genomic and \r\ntranscriptomic data with no limitation on ge-nome size or phylogenetic \r\ndistances. We successfully simultaneously clustered 169 genomic and \r\ntranscriptomic datasets from 4 kingdoms, achieving 100% accuracy at \r\nsupra-species level and 78% accuracy for species level.\r\n\r\nAvailability and Implementation: Cnidaria is written in C++ and Python and \r\nis available at http://www.ab.wur.nl/cnidaria.\r\n\r\nContact: sauloal@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at \r\nBioinformatics online.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-5291039-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
